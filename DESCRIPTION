Title: True Random Numbers using random.org
Description: The true random number service provided by the random.org 
 website created by Mads Haahr samples atmospheric noise via radio 
 tuned to an unused broadcasting frequency together with a skew
 correction algorithm due to John von Neumann.  More background is available
 in the included vignette based on an essay by Mads Haahr.  In its current
 form, the package offers functions to retrieve  random integers, randomized
 sequences and random strings.
